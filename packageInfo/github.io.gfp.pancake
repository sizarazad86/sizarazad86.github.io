PanCake brings this gesture to ALL of your apps,including stock ones and the ones from App Store！<br><br>Without PanCake,you can swipe back to go to previous screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen to the right.With PanCake,you can do this gesture without having to start from the edge,which is way more convenient!<br><br>Blacklist apps:<br><br>Some apps may have conflicting gestures.For example,in Spotify,swiping from Left to Right on a song name will allow you to add the song to the queue.That's why I've added a blacklist where you can select apps in which you want the gesture disabled.I've also already added some apps in blacklist default list,because they already have this gesture implemented natively.<br><br>Haptic Feedback:<br><br>Add a nice Haptic Feedback on dismiss end.Try it,you'll love how it feels.<br><br>It also supports phone with Right to Left layout, so people with RTL are not left away!",
